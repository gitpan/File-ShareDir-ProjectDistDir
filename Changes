Release history for File-ShareDir-ProjectDistDir

0.4.3 2013-05-23T18:29:12Z
 [00 Noteable Changes]
 - added basic debugging of the dev/prod determination logic, controlled by FILE_SHAREDIR_PROJECTDISTDIR_DEBUG=1

 [Tests]
 - added test case for Imagemagick

0.4.2 2013-05-23T17:11:31Z
 [Bug Fixes]
 - workaround for a user-installation that created a 'share' dir as a
   sibling of a 'lib' dir, which falsely lead us to believe the 'lib' dir
   was a "development lib dir", caused by a user installing ImageMagic
   wrongly.
 - This is only really a temporary solution, in lieu of better debugging
   diagnostics.

0.3.2 2012-05-07T17:07:54Z
 [Bugs]
 - github#2 There was a bug on some platforms where
   Path::Class::Dir->new('/')->parent->dir_list() returned a 2-item list
   instead of a one-item list which was our loop termination criteria. This
   became an infinite death loop on all platforms that have a "volume" (
   mac, win ). Has been resolved by performing a check to see if the path
   is the OS Specific path that represents a "root" from
   File::Spec->rootdir. Feedback on if this works or not requested, and if
   this still is a problem, I'll use $dir->parent eq $dir being the loop
   terminator.

0.3.1 2012-03-07T03:57:06Z
 [00 Summary]
 - Dropping 5.10.0 dependency back to 5.006 due to github#1. Apparently
   there is a sustainable way to use decimal versions in <=5.10.0 reliably
   via 'use version', so this is somewhat experimental consideration of
   that fact.

 - verbosely detailed the workings of the import method and its helper
   methods.

 - per export support for 'projectdir' allowing >1 dist_dir method to be
   exported.

 [Packaging]
