Release history for File-ShareDir-ProjectDistDir

0.3.2 2012-05-07T17:07:54Z
 [Bugs]
 - github#2 There was a bug on some platforms where
   Path::Class::Dir->new('/')->parent->dir_list() returned a 2-item list
   instead of a one-item list which was our loop termination criteria. This
   became an infinite death loop on all platforms that have a "volume" (
   mac, win ). Has been resolved by performing a check to see if the path
   is the OS Specific path that represents a "root" from
   File::Spec->rootdir. Feedback on if this works or not requested, and if
   this still is a problem, I'll use $dir->parent eq $dir being the loop
   terminator.

 [Dependencies::Changed]

0.3.1 2012-03-07T03:57:06Z
 [00 Summary]
 - Dropping 5.10.0 dependency back to 5.006 due to github#1. Apparently
   there is a sustainable way to use decimal versions in <=5.10.0 reliably
   via 'use version', so this is somewhat experimental consideration of
   that fact.

 [Dependencies::Changed]
 - runtime requires: perl 5.10 -> perl 5.006

0.3.0 2012-03-05T05:27:43Z
 [00 Noteworthy Changes]
 - New 'distname' parameter
 - greatly enhanced documentation
 - supports 'projectdir' on a per-export level.

0.2.0 2011-10-15T02:08:29Z
 [Dependencies::New]
 - Now declares a dependency on strict/warnings, but you probably didn't
   care. Its all DZils' fault.

 [Dependencies::Removed]
 - The useless dependency on `English` is gone from test-deps, as that test
   is no longer run for endusers.

 [Features]
 - Custom Project Dir:
 - Can now support passing a directory other than 'share' to use in your
   project.
 - eg: use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir qw( :all ), projectdir =>
   'templates';
 - Thank Getty/Torsten Raudssus for requesting this feature.

 [Packaging]
 - Re-generated License from more recent template ( minor indentation
   changes, change of address )

   based mangling, no longer spams you during install, and are now only
   even notable during `dzil release` and `dzil xtest`. ( See
   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests> for details.
 - All github URL's now point to https:// paths.
 - Now uses Authority plugin to create $AUTHORITY headings and x_authority
   = cpan:KENTNL

 [Tests]
