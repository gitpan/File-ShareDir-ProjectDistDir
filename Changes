Release history for File-ShareDir-ProjectDistDir

0.2.0 2011-10-15T02:08:29Z
 [Dependencies::New]
 - Now declares a dependency on strict/warnings, but you probably didn't
   care. Its all DZils' fault.

 [Dependencies::Removed]
 - The useless dependency on `English` is gone from test-deps, as that test
   is no longer run for endusers.

 [Features]
 - Custom Project Dir:
 - Can now support passing a directory other than 'share' to use in your
   project.
 - eg: use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir qw( :all ), projectdir =>
   'templates';
 - Thank Getty/Torsten Raudssus for requesting this feature.

 - $VERSION is no longer set during BEGIN ( Dist::Zilla )

 [Packaging]
 - Re-generated License from more recent template ( minor indentation
   changes, change of address )
 - AuthorTests/ReleaseTests no longer stored in t/, no longer do ENV{}
   based mangling, no longer spams you during install, and are now only
   even notable during `dzil release` and `dzil xtest`. ( See
   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests> for details.
 - All github URL's now point to https:// paths.
