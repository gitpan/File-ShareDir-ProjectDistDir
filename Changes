0.4.2 2013-05-23T17:11:31Z
 [Bug Fixes]
 - workaround for a user-installation that created a 'share' dir as a sibling of a 'lib' dir, which falsely lead us to
   believe the 'lib' dir was a "development lib dir", caused by a user installing ImageMagic wrongly.
 - This is only really a temporary solution, in lieu of better debugging diagnostics.

0.3.2 2012-05-07T17:07:54Z
 [Bugs]
 - github#2 There was a bug on some platforms where Path::Class::Dir->new('/')->parent->dir_list() returned a 2-item
   list instead of a one-item list which was our loop termination criteria. This became an infinite death loop on all
   platforms that have a "volume" ( mac, win ). Has been resolved by performing a check to see if the path is the OS
   Specific path that represents a "root" from File::Spec->rootdir. Feedback on if this works or not requested, and if
   this still is a problem, I'll use $dir->parent eq $dir being the loop terminator.

0.3.1 2012-03-07T03:57:06Z
 [00 Summary]
 - Dropping 5.10.0 dependency back to 5.006 due to github#1. Apparently there is a sustainable way to use decimal
   versions in <=5.10.0 reliably via 'use version', so this is somewhat experimental consideration of that fact.
