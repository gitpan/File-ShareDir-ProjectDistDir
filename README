NAME
    File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir - Simple set-and-forget using of a
    '/share' directory in your projects root

VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
      package An::Example::Package;

      use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir;

      # during development, $dir will be $projectroot/share
      # but once installed, it will be wherever File::Sharedir thinks it is.
      my $dir = dist_dir('An-Example')

    Project layout requirements:

      $project/
      $project/lib/An/Example/Package.pm
      $project/share/   # files for package 'An-Example' go here.

METHODS
  build_dist_dir
    Generates the exported 'dist_dir' method. In development environments,
    the generated method will return a path to the development directories
    'share' directory. In non-development environments, this simply returns
    "File::ShareDir::dist_dir".

    As a result of this, specifying the Distribution name is not required
    during development, however, it will start to matter once it is
    installed. This is a potential avenues for bugs if you happen to name it
    wrong.

  build_dist_file
    Generates the 'dist_file' method.

    In development environments, the generated method will return a path to
    the development directories 'share' directory. In non-development
    environments, this simply returns "File::ShareDir::dist_file".

    Caveats as a result of package-name as stated in "build_dist_dir" also
    apply to this method.
